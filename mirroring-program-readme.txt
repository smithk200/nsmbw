How to use the mirroring program

Requirements: Python 2.7. This is the program that I use to output the text. You should also use IDLE, as this program was designed to putput text to the IDLE shell.

ONLY MODIFY THE "REPLACEMENTS" PART OF THE CODE! MODIFYING ANYTHING ELSE WILL NOT CAUSE IT TO WORK PROPERLY!
All you need to do is to modify the text in the "replacements" part of the code. The left side of the replacements dictionary is the part of the code that is the original object name, and the right side of the replacements
dictionary is the part of the code that the object should be replaced with. For instance, if you want Object 3 in Reggie to be Object 4, simply write "03" : "4" ,
You must put a "0" in front of the first number, otherwise the code will replace all the "3"s, not just Object 3.
It outputs text to the shell, which you can paste directly into Reggie.
